Arvialo deploys every application as a Docker container. This means your application runs in its own isolated container. 

To run a container, you need a Docker image built from your source code. 

Build packs helps to create this Docker image and manage the build and deployment process.


## Why Use Build Packs?
- **Simplifies the Build Process:** Some Build packs automatically create the Docker image needed for deployment, so you don’t have to spend time on learning how to write Dockerfiles on your own.

- **Flexibility for Different Projects:** Since every application is different, you can choose a build pack that suits your specific needs, whether you prefer an automated solution or a custom configuration.


## How Build Packs Work
Each build pack offers a different approach to building your Docker image:

- **Automated Dockerfile Creation:** Build packs like Nixpacks & Static Build Pack automatically generate a Dockerfile based on your codebase and builds the docker image. 
  - This allows you to deploy your application quickly without having to write the Dockerfile yourself.

- **Custom Dockerfile or Docker Compose:** Build packs like Dockerfile & Docker Compose let you use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file that you have already have on your codebase. 
  - This gives you full control over how your Docker image is built and how multiple services work together.


## Choose the Right Build Pack
Arvialo have four build packs to meet different requirements:
- **Nixpacks:** Good for quick and automated Docker image creation with minimal configuration.

- **Static Build Pack:** Perfect for static sites and simple applications that don’t need server-side processing.

- **Dockerfile:** Use your own Dockerfile, if you want full control over the docker image build process.

- **Docker Compose:** Perfect to Deploy complex, multi-service applications using your custom Docker Compose file.
