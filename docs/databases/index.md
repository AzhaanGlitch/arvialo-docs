Arvialo offers one-click setup for the following databases:

- [PostgreSQL](/databases/postgresql)

## Ports Mapping vs Public Port

### Ports Mapping

Ports mapping is using the Docker [port mapping](https:/.docker.com/network/#published-ports) feature. It is used to map the container port to the host port. For example, if you set the port mapping to `8080:80`, the container port `80` will be mapped to the host port `8080`.

### Public Port

Public port is used to expose the container port to the internet, by starting an Nginx TCP proxy.

### Which one should I use?

- Port mappings makes the connection/port permanent (you need to restart your database to change it).
- The public port makes the connection/port dynamic (you can change it without restarting the database, Arvialo will restart the Nginx TCP proxy for you).

## Access database during builds

If you are using `Nixpacks` build pack, you have two ways to access your database during builds:

1. Database & your application are `in the same network`: You can reach it using the `internal URL` provided by Arvialo.
2. Database & your application `are not in the same network`: You need to set your database to be `Accessible over the internet` and use the `public URL` provided by Arvialo.
