So, you’ve decided to use Arvialo, awesome choice! 

Now, you might be wondering whether to go with **Arvialo Cloud** or set it up yourself through **self-hosting**. Let’s break it down so you can pick the best option for you.


## Arvialo Cloud
Arvialo Cloud is the easy way to get started. It’s a paid service (starting at just **$5 a month**) where you bring your own servers and connect them to a Arvialo instance that’s fully managed by our team. 

::: warning **Note** 
  **We host and update the Arvialo instance for you, so you don't have to allocate any of your server resources to Arvialo, but you’re still responsible for your own servers and any other services running on them**
:::


## Arvialo Self-Hosted 
If you’re more of a hands-on person, self-hosting Arvialo might be your thing. 

It’s completely free (except for your server costs, of course), and you get to control everything. 

You’ll install Arvialo on your own server, keep it updated, and manage all the related services yourself.
