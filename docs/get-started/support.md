## Direct Support from Core Developers
If you are a **Arvialo Cloud user**, you can reach out via email at **hi@arvialo.io** for direct support from Founders. Since he personally handles emails, response times may be delayed. 

We highly recommend posting in the **Discord support forum** first, as core team members can escalate issues to the developers Ekjot & Azhaan if necessary.  

## Important Notes  
- We are a **small team** (fewer than **6 people**) supporting **140K+ users**, making it challenging to offer direct assistance to everyone. However, we do our best to help as much as possible.  
- We are planning a **paid support option** for **self-hosted users**. If you need dedicated support for your **self-hosted instance**, email **hi@arvialo.io** to discuss options.
